        Our service is personal and sincere, offering a luxury experience from the moment you touchdown in Kenya.
        Your dedicated butler will know that you prefer Earl Grey to Assam with your scones, and will remember which trousers you like pressed flat and which ones need a central crease.
        So while you are indulging in the spa, relaxing beside the pool or meandering through the gardens, back in your suite, your butler will have dimmed the lights, 
        adjusted your personalized pillows, set out your nightcap and arranged the morning’s outing down to the finest detail.
